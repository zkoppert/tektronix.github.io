# Contributor Licensing Agreement

Before accepting Contributions from any person or entity, Tektronix, Inc. ("Tektronix") needs each Contributor to sign a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"), indicating their agreement to the terms below. This license protects you as a Contributor as well as Tektronix; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for all Contributions You submit to Tektronix. Except for the license granted herein to Tektronix (and recipients of software distributed by Tektronix or its Affiliates), You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. **Definitions.**

   1. “Affiliates” for a given entity means all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the direct or indirect power to direct or manage such entity, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   2. “Contribution” means any original work of authorship—including any modifications or additions—that is intentionally communicated or submitted (in any form) by You for Tektronix to include in any of the projects owned or managed by Tektronix (the “Work”). Contributions exclude any communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated as “Not a Contribution.”

   3. “You,” “Your,” or “Contributor” means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Tektronix. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and its Affiliates are considered to be a single Contributor.

2. **Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Tektronix and its Affiliates and recipients of software distributed by Tektronix or its Affiliates, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and any such derivative works.

3. **Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Tektronix and its Affiliates and recipients of software distributed by Tektronix or its Affiliates a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work. Such license applies only to patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license(s). If Your employer(s) has any rights to Your Contributions, you represent that (i) you have received permission to make Your Contributions on behalf of that employer, (ii) your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Tektronix, or (iii) that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Tektronix.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is either Your original creation or is submitted under section 7 (submissions on behalf of others). If any part of Your Contributions are associated with a third-party license or restriction (including but not limited to related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware, You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any such third-party license or other restriction.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, but You may do so to the extent you desire to. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Tektronix separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]”.

8. You agree to notify Tektronix of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
